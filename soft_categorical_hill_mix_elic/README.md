We modify the [`CIFAR-10S`](https://github.com/cambridge-mlg/cifar-10s/tree/master) elicitation interface. Please refer to (and consider citing) the `CIFAR-10S` source if modifying the categorical, per-annotator soft label elicitation.

Please see the [original elicitation interface repo](https://github.com/cambridge-mlg/cifar-10s/tree/master/elicitation_interface), alongside further details on launching Pavlovia-based interfaces in the [``../hill_mixe_suite/`` directory](https://github.com/cambridge-mlg/hill-mixup/tree/main/hill_mixe_suite) in this repo.
